# Map and sav extensions
Extends the .map, .msv, and .sav file format. 

This extension provides functionality for other extensions. For example, the Automarket stores the automarket configuration into save files such that the specific configuration of that game can be loaded when loading a save file.

The module is based on the knowledge from [here](https://github.com/sourcehold/sourcehold-maps).
